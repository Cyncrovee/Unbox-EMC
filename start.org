* Welcome to my Emacs configuration!
If this is your first time booting, you may see some warning/error messages. These (hopefully) shouldnâ€™t be a problem unless they show up again after reboot.

You can access the user.el file with "<leader> ffe". This file is for high level configuration, and is intended to be relatively simple and easy to use.
If you want to access the full config, you can use "<leader> ffc".

** The leader key is most likely set to space.

*** Quick Access
====== Open the user config file, for base configuration: "<leader> ffe" ======
====== Open the Config Directory: "<leader> ffc"                         ======
====== Open a Project: "<leader> fps"                                    ======
====== Open the Buffer Menu: "<leader> bm"                               ======
====== Exit Emacs: "<leader> qq"                                         ======
====== Restart Emacs: "<leader> qr"                                      ======
